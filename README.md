# Typo, a Hugo theme.

Typo is a theme backed by simplicity, as you can see in the screenshots below. The goal was to have a website centered around content and nothing more.

## 1 Wiki

Typo's [Wiki](https://tomfran.github.io/typo-wiki/) is the place to find instructions on how to [setup](https://tomfran.github.io/typo-wiki/setup) the theme and an overview of the available [features](https://tomfran.github.io/typo-wiki/features). 

Some of the most relevant are: heading auto-numbering, dark mode, color palettes, dark and light images, comments, etc.
